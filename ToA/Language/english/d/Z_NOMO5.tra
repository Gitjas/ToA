@0    = ~Ah! Wonderful! I can see you have traversed the path through darkness and opened it for the final blow. Our enemies may well make their final strike, if they remember the way is free again! That is why we must act quickly. Ah yes, I see you possess the scroll I have been looking for, thank you.~ [ZNOMOR15]
@1    = ~Why have you not helped us? And what is up with this scroll?~
@2    = ~But, but! Do not be so aggressive! Rejoice if you prefer, your mission is almost over and you can go back on your way, you have saved all of the Sword Coast, what more do you want? This scroll is only one of my experiments, nothing special but important for me. You are still alive, so you needed it anyway. But now you need my help, we must jointly open the portal and defeat the evil behind it!~ [ZNOMOR16]
@3    = ~We are not ready for it.~
@4    = ~Ok, let it pass through us.~
@5    = ~Come back soon! I will wait here for you as long as needed.~ [ZNOMOR17]
@6    = ~Are you ready now? It is important that you are well prepared, who knows what lies behind.~ [ZNOMOR18]
