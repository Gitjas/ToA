@0    = ~Ah, finally you are here, I have been waiting for you.~ [ZNOMOR11]
@1    = ~Bloody hell, I'll not be taken any longer! Who is responsible for the resurrection of the Legion?!~
@2    = ~Why have you not helped us in the mountains?~
@3    = ~Yes, here we are, what should we do?~
@4    = ~The question I can not exactly answer you, I can only say this to you: we must tackle the evil at its roots, and destroy it, if we want to be victorious. And we can only do this when we walk through the portal. Kill the guards and we will jointly open the gate and face the evil.~ [ZNOMOR12]
@5    = ~I am a powerful mage, but not responsible for everything, right? I took care of it so that the dwarfs are stuck for the time being with the construction of the cave and thus can provide no other exit from which this horde of monsters could proceed. Proceed further into the cave, and kill the guards, then we will see what happens.~ [ZNOMOR13]
@6    = ~Dive into the cave, killing the guard and pass through the portal with me, and, we will tackle the evil at its roots!~ [ZNOMOR13]
