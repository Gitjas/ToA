@0    = ~Well well, you've done it so effectively, here in the frozen north.~ [ZNOMOR50]
@1    = ~But what do I see? Your beloved army of the Ten Towns is defeated! The legion will march from the Ten Towns - continue to Luskan - down to Baldur's Gate, and no one will stop them. In the meantime, I will destroy the battered fabric of magic. For you, here, the game ends. You were a worthy opponent, but no match nontheless. Time for your last breath.~ [ZNOMOR51]
