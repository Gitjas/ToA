@0    = ~You are the heroes brought by Nomoran, are you not? Yeah, that is you. Who else should you be. Since the blocking of the passage, there are not many visitors here. Could I ask a favor? I am a dealer and own a shop in the city, not to be missed as it sais 'Emir Store' on a big sign at the door. When I escaped, I left my greatest treasure. Not of great material value, but very important to me. Namely, my pipe! For days I have smoked nothing and am in agony! What do you say?~
@1    = ~If I find the pipe, I will bring it to you.~
@2    = ~Hohoho! I'm Santa Claus! ... just a joke! Nevertheless, an enjoyable one. Namely, that I am the last dealer of this city and therefore the only one to offer you goods and to buy all unnecessary small things you want to get rid of! Are you in?~
@3    = ~Sure! Show me your wares.~
@4    = ~You're crazy, leave me alone.~
@5    = ~You've found my pipe, that's wonderful! Only ... I need something to smoke! Could you bring some dried leaves? They are hidden at the marketplace. The ones with red berries.~
@6    = ~You have found my weed! Please, please, give it to me!~
@7    = ~Aahhh! Really nice - take this, as a thank you from me.~
