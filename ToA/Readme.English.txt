Baldur's Gate II - Tales of Anegh
Original by Naurandir
Weidu version by White Agnus
Version 2.6

About the modification:
In this history it is about a connection between Icewind Dale and Baldurs Gate 2.
Then in Athkatla magician Nomoran (in ToB you meet in Saradush, if the Mod 
was not played in SoA) and asks you for help in the fight against a monster horde.
By his magic you reach directly in the mountains near the village "Anegh". Depending on, 
whether you play the Mod in SoA or in ToB, it has two different endings.

Installation:
Simply the Seupt-toa.exe and the ToA folder in the BG2 directory lay, the Setup-toa.exe
start and the instructions follow.

Compatibility:
ToA was created with Weidu v208-v211 and should be compatible with every other Weidu Mod.
 

Contact with problems:
If you should have problems with the Mod, feel free in the Kerzenburg or in the Rosenranken
 forum to post, or write an email to whiteagnus@gmx.de.
